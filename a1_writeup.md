# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    My initial thoughts on python programming language is that while it may be easier-because the language can just assume many things (ie. not needing to declare a variable only initializing)- I personally find it a little harder to grasp than Java. In Java, you have to write everything out but in python, there are so many functions and shortcuts that makes programming faster, but I don't understand the syntax as well(ie. dictionaries and slices)


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    (Only worked in Java) First there are no colons, declaring classes is not 'public class' rather 'def', for loops are more flexible and the syntax is different, there is an 'assert' function that allows to check a method (really useful). But similarities would be that they share the same 'function', there syntaxes may be different but they carry out the same task. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    The assert function helps you check your methods. Slices are really helpful for lists (makes a substring of the list). In order to truncate integers (make sure its not a float) you have to do '//' not '/' the singular dash gives you a float. .append() is the equivalent of .add().
