"""Assignment 1

Fill in the following function skeletons - descriptions are provided in 
the docstring (the triple quote thing at the top of each function)

Some assert statements have been provided - write more of them to test your code!

The `raise NotImplementedError(...)`s are placeholders to help you not skip implementing
a function. They should be removed and replaced with your solution.

This portion of the assignment will not be graded, but this gives you some problems to 
check, if you do not complete the generative AI portion of the assignment.
